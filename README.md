## Overview ##

As the world’s most popular programmer Q&amp;A community, StackOverflow is a showcase of a
successful usage of the tag system, where each question could have one or more tags to indicate
its ”topics”. 

Tags offers rich yet flexible semantic information about questions. In this project, we
aim at predicting the tags of new questions by mining the large amount of tagged questions.

Moreover, we also extend the concept of tags to the user, where users' tags will be determined the
questions they asked/answered/favorited/voted. By doing this we can make personalized recommendation 
of intesesting new questions and similiar users.
