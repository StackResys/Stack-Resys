\section {Future Work}
Our work has untapped an interesting area of social tagging. We believe that tag prediction is not trivial because it can be used in many applications. Here are a few possible scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Tag Suggestion:} When a user is posting a new question, the system can suggest tags for the given content.
    \item \emph{Discover the ``hidden" tags:} User-defined tag maybe subjective and incomplete. The tag predictor could be used to discover the ``hidden" tags. Moreover, with more tags being found the system can better match a question and a user's preference.
\end{itemize}
