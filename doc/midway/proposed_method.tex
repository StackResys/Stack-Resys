\subsection{Naive Bayes}
Naive Bayes \cite{NaiveBayes} classifier is a simple yet powerful classifier based on applying Bayes theorem. It assumes that the presence of a feature is independent from the presence of the other features. When performing the text categorization, Naive Bayes treats each document as a "bag of words" and words are conditionally independent from each other.

In practice, naive Bayes classifiers can have a very satisfactory performance in a supervised learning. Many real-world problems are tackled by naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood; in other words, one can work with the naive Bayes model without believing in Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods.
