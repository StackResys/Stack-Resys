As the world's most popular programmer Q\&A community, StackOverflow.com is a showcase of the successful usage of the tagging system, where each question could have one or more tags to indicate its "topics". 

Traditional hierarchical taxonomies force each item to be one of the predefined categories, however in a tagging system one item could have multiple categories(the "tags"). Furthermore, besides applying the existing tags, users can easily create a new tag to describe an item if appropriate. Also, by gathering the "wisdom of the crowd", an item can have more precise and comprehensive descriptors from users of different propsective. 

With great interest in the rich semantic informaion revealed by the tags, in this project we aim at predicting the tags of a question by 
by analyzing the tagged questions/answers of StackOverflow.com. That is, given a question, our system will predict appropriate tags for it. With the tag predictor, a user could have suggested tags at hand as soon as he/she asked a question. This will fascilitate tagging task. Sen et al. [16] indicate that with suggestion people are more likely to assign items with higher quality tags.

What's more, the tag prediction will also benefit the already tagged questions by giving us a deeper insight into a tagged in the follwoing ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reveal the hidden tags: often a piece of text is a mix of different topics while a user often only choose a fraction of them as the tags. That is to say, the tags only indicates the "partial topics" of the text. With the tag prediction technology, we're able to discover the unspecified tags.
    \item Discover the Vocabulary difference: different users may use different terms to describe the same item. It's easy to ...
    \item Ambiguity: Many tags are ambiguous. Additional tags will help to disambiguate them. For example, the meaning of tag "apple" will be clearer if we found the hidden tags "osx", "iphone".
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we ...
