As the world's most popular programmer Q\&A community, StackOverflow.com is a showcase of the successful usage of the tagging system, where each question could have one or more tags to indicate its ``topics". 

Traditional hierarchical taxonomies force each item to be one of the predefined categories, however in a tagging system one item could have multiple categories(the ``tags"). Moreover, the tagging systems normally encourages users to contribute their tags. Thus, by gathering the ``wisdom of the crowd", an item can have more precise and comprehensive descriptors from users of different prospective. 

In this project we aim at predicting the tags of a question by analyzing the tagged questions/answers from StackOverflow.com. That is, given a question, our system will predict appropriate tags for it. With the tag predictor, a user could have suggested tags at hand as soon as he/she asked a question. This will facilitate tagging task. Sen et al.\cite{Sen2006} indicate that with suggestion people are more likely to assign items with higher quality tags.

Moreover, the tag prediction will also benefit the already tagged questions by giving us a deeper insight into that question in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reveal the hidden tags: often a piece of text is a mix of different topics while a user often only choose a fraction of them as the tags. That is to say, the tags only indicate the ``partial topics" of the text. With the tag prediction technology, we're able to discover the ``hidden" tags.
    \item Discover the Vocabulary difference: different users may use different terms to describe the same item. Our predictor can be a good assistant in finding the synonym tags because similar tag will have similar distribution.
    \item Disambiguation: Many tags are ambiguous. With additionally predicted tags it will easier grasp the meaning of a specific tag. For example, an article with tag ``apple" may tell us little of its content, but if found the hidden tags ``osx", ``iphone" then we know exactly what ``apple" mean in this text.
\end{itemize}

In this project, we will adopt and improve several methods to predict the tags of the questions in StackOverflow.com.
