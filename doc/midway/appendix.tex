{\bf Project Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data Observation: Finished.
    \item Investigation of text classfication methods: Finished.
    \item Feature Selection: Finished.
    \item Development of classification models: Finished the development of naive Bayes and logistic regression. Almost finished neural network.
    \item Experiments: Finished the experiments on naive Bayes. Will continue the experiments on logistic regression and neural network. Meanwhile, we'll also develop some tools to ease the performance evaluation of models.
    \item Demo(optional): We may develop a demo that could make tags suggestion, qeustion recommendation, etc.
\end{enumerate}
